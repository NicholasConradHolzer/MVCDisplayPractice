last error holding up progress on:

https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/young-springs-24759

was:
"
ConnectionError [SequelizeConnectionError]: Unknown database 'le_tech'
"
so there is likely a nameing error somewhere in the codebase related to its reverse engineered quality that needs to be update to match the new branding.
